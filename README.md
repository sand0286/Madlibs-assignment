# Madlibs

## Introduction
Madlibs are a `[Adjective]` for the whole `[Noun]`.

## Objective

For this exercise, you will be demonstrating your understanding of objects, arrays, and template literals to complete four different Madlibs stories. 

## Requirements

The following requirements must be met in order to complete the assignment successfully:

1. Clone this repository from GitHub. **Aside from this README file, there are NO starter files for this project.** 
2. Create a `index.html` file and a `script.js` file. The `index.html` file should contain a standard HTML5 structure and should add `script.js` using the `<script></script>` tag.
3. Follow the instructions below to create 2 versions of Little Red Riding Hood and 2 versions of Snow White. **There will be 4 stories in total.**

### Little Red Riding Hood

#### Part 1

Create a new object, with variable name `littleRed`, for the story "Little Red Riding Hood". The object should contain the following properties:

1.  A **color** as a `string`
2.  An `array of strings` with each string being a **plural noun**. There should be a total of 4 strings
3.  An **adjective** as a `string`
4.  An **exclamation** as a `string`
5.  A **silly word** as a `string`
6.  An `array of strings` with each string being a **verb**. The first verb in the array should be past tense. There should be a total of 3 strings.

Use a template literal and the object described above to complete the following story and output it to the console.

```
One day, Little [color] Riding Hood was going through the forest carrying a 
basket of [plural noun 1] for her grandmother. Suddenly, she met a big 
[adjective] wolf.

"[exclamation]" said the wolf. "Where are you going little [silly word]?"

"I'm going to my grandmother's house," she said. Then the wolf 
[verb 1 (past tense)] away.

When Miss Riding Hood got to her grandmother's house, the wolf was in bed 
dressed like her grandmother.

"My, Grandmother," she said. "What big [plural noun 2] you have."

"The better to [verb 2] you with," said the wolf.

"And, Grandmother," she said, "what big [plural noun 3]" you have."

The wolf said, "The better to [verb 3] you with."

And then she said, "What big [plural noun 4]" you have, Grandmother." But 
the wolf said nothing. He had just died of indigestion from eating Grandmother

3.  Change the **exclamation** to a different **exclamation**

Complete the story above using the update object and output it to the console.

### Snow White

```
One of the most popular fairy [plural noun 1] of all time is Snow White and the 
[number] [plural noun 2].

Snow White is a princess whose [adjective 1] beauty threatens her stepmother,
